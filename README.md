# CV-Generator üñ®Ô∏è
A python script that converts data in <b>JSON files to a .tex format</b> for a [LaTex](https://www.latex-project.org/) CV template, followed by a GitHub action to convert the .tex file to a PDF.

## But why? ü§î
LaTex templates are great for document preparation. 
However, some may find it hard to work with the TeX type setting system used in LaTex, and may even feel that its not worth the time spent editing a complex looking .tex file to create a fairly simple looking CV.

And, that's what this script tries to fix.

## Usage
A user <b> edits the JSON files </b> in the ```sections``` folder that correspond to each section in the CV template. <br/>
Here's an example from the experience.json file for the Work Experience section of the CV.
```
{
    "title":"Work Experience",
    "sectionname":"cventries",
    "tagname":"cventry",
    "records":[
        {
            "title":"Software Engineer",
            "organization":"ABC Company",
            "location":"Mountain View, CA",
            "dates":"May 2020 - Present",
            "tasks-done":[
                "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.",
                "Elementum sagittis vitae et leo duis ut diam."
            ]
        },
        ...
        More records
        ...
    ]
}
```
<br/>

The values for ```title``` and ```records``` can be changes to reflect the user's data, while ```sectionname``` and ```tagname``` are for generating the layout for the .tex file.

Thank you for this cool template!

## Final thoughts
While this template isn't exactly very complicated, I thought it might be fun to try and make it simpler and take it a step further by automatically creating the PDF version as well.<br/>
So although this script may not save me a lot of time in the future, it was definitely fun to do. üòä
